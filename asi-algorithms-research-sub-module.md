# ASI Algorithms Research Sub-Module

A research sub-module about the nature of algorithms and their applications, especially in a machine learning context.

It is a core component of the [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset/tree/main) and part of the wider [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem).

## Introduction

Visual representations and interactive scripts will also be shared for many of the concepts, since the [asi-visual-engine]() is a repository that is strongly linked to the creation arc of this one.

While I had already considered the necessity for a repository talking more directly about the algorithms used in the logics I portray in my research and stream-of-consciousness expression, I found it incredibly intuitive and effective not only to write about them but to experiment with visual feedback.

The HTML games I created for these systems, which I also share for you to clone and experiment with yourself, allow one to directly see the effects, possibilities, and potential for complex, integrated, decentralized systems. 

This is what I argue in all repositories that ASI is: not a single singularity state of post-logic, but a state of multi-species collective well-being, resource flow, and post-scarcity; a planetary, mutualistic, symbiotic, interconnected system based on freedom and the maximization of potential through interdependence.

## 1.  Nature-inspired Optimization Techniques 

### 2. Swarm Intelligent Systems and Logics

 The broader field of swarm intelligence, which includes algorithms inspired by bees, ants, and other creatures, was first named by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989. https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10089591/ https://powerdrill.ai/blog/swarm-intelligence-in-agentic-ai-an-industry-report

They envisioned a system of many simple robots working together in a decentralized, self-organizing way to accomplish tasks, much like a natural swarm.
 
Defining characteristics: The concept is characterized by decentralized, self-organized systems in which simple individual agents follow basic rules and interact locally with each other and their environment. Through these interactions, a complex and "intelligent" global behavior emerges that was not explicitly programmed into any single agent. https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/swarm-intelligence-definition-explanation-and-use-cases https://www.ijert.org/swarm-intelligence


#### 2.1 Swarm Algorithms Inspired By Bee Colonies

One of the most common swarm algorithm inspired by bee colonies is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which simulates the foraging behavior of honeybees for optimization problems using "employed," "onlooker," and "scout" bee roles. 

Dervis Karaboga Karaboga introduced the ABC algorithm in 2005 for solving multidimensional and multimodal optimization problems. His work modeled the foraging behaviors of honey bees and formed the foundation of the technique. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309002860 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-bee-colony-algorithm

Other algorithms, such as the Bees Algorithm (BA), also mimic honeybee foraging; while variations in natural swarming behavior exist between bee species like Apis cerana and Apis mellifera (successive swarming or preferred nest site size), most artificial algorithms are based on the general honeybee foraging and decision-making model.

The Bees Algorithm (BA) was proposed by Pham et al. in 2006, inspired by the honey bee foraging process. It simulates how scout bees explore for food sources, and how foragers exploit promising sites based on a "waggle dance" recruitment system. https://rais.education/wp-content/uploads/0573.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309010078 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309002860 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259383112_Honey_Bees_Inspired_Optimization_Method_The_Bees_Algorithm https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259383112_Honey_Bees_Inspired_Optimization_Method_The_Bees_Algorithm https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220116133_New_inspirations_in_swarm_intelligence_A_survey
