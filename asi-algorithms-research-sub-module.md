# ASI Algorithms Research Sub-Module

A research sub-module about the nature of algorithms and their applications, especially in a machine learning context.

It is a core component of the [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset/tree/main) and part of the wider [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem).

## Introduction

Visual representations and interactive scripts will also be shared for many of the concepts, since the [asi-visual-engine]() is a repository that is strongly linked to the creation arc of this one.

While I had already considered the necessity for a repository talking more directly about the algorithms used in the logics I portray in my research and stream-of-consciousness expression, I found it incredibly intuitive and effective not only to write about them but to experiment with visual feedback.

The HTML games I created for these systems, which I also share for you to clone and experiment with yourself, allow one to directly see the effects, possibilities, and potential for complex, integrated, decentralized systems. 

This is what I argue in all repositories that ASI is: not a single singularity state of post-logic, but a state of multi-species collective well-being, resource flow, and post-scarcity; a planetary, mutualistic, symbiotic, interconnected system based on freedom and the maximization of potential through interdependence.

#### 2.1 Swarm Algorithms Inspired By Bee Colonies

One of the most common swarm algorithm inspired by bee colonies is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which simulates the foraging behavior of honeybees for optimization problems using "employed," "onlooker," and "scout" bee roles. 

Other algorithms, such as the Bees Algorithm (BA), also mimic honeybee foraging; while variations in natural swarming behavior exist between bee species like Apis cerana and Apis mellifera (successive swarming or preferred nest site size), most artificial algorithms are based on the general honeybee foraging and decision-making model.
